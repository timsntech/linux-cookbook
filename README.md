# :sparkles: The Linux Cookbook :sparkles:

Hello, friend. This Linux Cookbook contains commands how to manage and navigate Linux systems.

The cookbook is based on my previous experience with Linux and is targeted to beginners and more advanced users of Linux, who just want to get a simple overview of the different commands you can do in Linux.

Please note this book does not aim to include all available commands and topics, but enough to get you either started with Linux if you are new or to refresh your knowledge on some topics. The whole project here is definitely a work in progress.

## Content of this book

Some of the topics covered in this cookbook include:

- Navigating the Linux Terminal
- Managing Files and Directories
- Viewing and Printing Files and Terminal-based file and text editing
- Installing, Updating, Upgrading of packages and services
- Managing File Permissions
- FTP and SCP
- Managing Linux processes
- Handling Linux State Information
- Managing and controlling access and user management
- and more ...

## Get started

Just start reading with the sections you are interested in, the content is separated into the different topics mentioned above. If you have no or little experience with Linux Terminal I would recommend to start with Navigating the Linux Terminal.

## Contribution

In case you discover this repo and you want to contribute, feel free to do so. This is a personal project I do for myself and others who may find it helpful and any help or suggestions for improvement are very welcome.

Let's have some fun with Linux. :sparkles:
